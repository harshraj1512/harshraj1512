## ðŸš€ About Me
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Myself Harsh Raj persuing B.Tech in CSE specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Solving problems creatively is what I do. I am an AI ML enthusiast, looking around for things.

I have learned the importance of applying classical strategies to modern-day projects. I am an intermediate coder in python and Java. I have done some Advanced python projects to in my college life using some of the most popular libraries used - Tkinter, pandas, NumPy, and many more.
